# Naming
## General:
http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions

## For this project
### Classes
For classes please use capitalisation as a separator (CapWords convention)
```MyClass```

### Functions
Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as 
necessary to improve readability.
```my_function_that_does_awesome_things()```

### Variables
```my_var```
```__my_private_var```
Please avoid to use built-in function names as variable names 
(https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html).
Frequent examples are ```file``` and ```bin```.

### Constants
Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words. 
Examples include ```MAX_OVERFLOW``` and ```TOTAL```.
