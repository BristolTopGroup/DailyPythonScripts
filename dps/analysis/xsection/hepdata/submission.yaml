comment: "CERN-LHC. Measurements of differential tt production cross sections are presented in the single-lepton decay channel, as a function of a number of kinematic event variables.  The measurements are performed with proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC during 2016, with an integrated luminosity of 35.9/fb.  The data are compared to a variety of state-of-the-art leading-order and next-to-leading-order tt simulations."
